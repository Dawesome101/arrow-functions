# Introduction to arrow functions

## [Pull Request for assignment](https://github.com/Dawesome101/arrow-functions/pull/1)

Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:  

1. A question within the context of today’s lab assignment
   - Why would I want to use arrow functions when function expressions and declarations do the same thing only better and less confusing?
2. An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment
   - Honestly, the entire arrow function concept is a little lost on me other than when using one liners for quick and dirty style coding.
3. How long you spent working on this assignment
   - About an hour.
